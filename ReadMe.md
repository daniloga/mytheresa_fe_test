**FE REACT/VUE TECHNICAL TEST**

The main requirement for the technical test is to do it with ES6. We don't use TypeScript as part of our stack but it's up to you to use it in the challenge if you feel more comfortable with it. +

Depending on the position you are applying, a different stack is required:
  - React, Redux and a router of your election +
  - Vue, Vuex and a router of your election -

Once you know which one you need to use, here is the rest of test:

- Choose the build tool you prefer – we like Webpack +
- Use any open API you feel more comfortable with – we suggest to use [TheMovieDatabase API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) +
- The app should contain:
  - A home page listing several categories of items +
  - A category page (with pagination) to show its items +
  - A detail page of an item with detailed information +
- Nice-to-have features:
  - An "Add to cart" button in item's detail page +
  - A cart section to manage the products already added +
  - Live search +
  - Pagination as infinite scrolling +
  - Server Side Rendering -
- A minimum of clean CSS +
- Test as much as you can +
- Create a README file with some documentation +

Ways to send us the code:
- Upload it to a repo on GitHub +
- Send us a .zip file
- Even better; give us access to the code in some way and deploy the app somewhere giving us access :) +
